# MinBAR

MinBAR is an R package that aims at (1) defining what is the minimum or optimal background extent necessary to fit good partial SDMs and/or (2) determining if the background area used to fit a partial SDM is reliable enough to extract ecologically relevant conclusions from it.

The main function of MinBAR is minba. In the version 1.0.0 of the package presented here, minba is implemented for MaxEnt models and uses the Boyce Index as a measure of model performance.
